~~~~~~~~ AREA code ToDo

REDESIGN HTML
	- Try to integrate filter TAB in first TAB or somewhere else

INTERACTION JAVASCRIPT
	- Make press-ENTER equals to click in apply and filter bottons
	' Unpop node-info with "ESC" key
	- FILTERs: add check/uncheck all
	- FILTER RIGHT COLUMN: add "filter by topic" with a topic list dropdown. 
	- Add alt (or toolbox) with param2 value on mouse over.
		BETTER -> title + authors + year for each node onmouseover

INTERNAL JAVASCRIPT
	- In filter, selection of filters gets lost when reload (all checked)
	- Be sure that if "human" propierty is "" or not defined, then AREA uses machine-name
	- Try to find a IntjsonAPI to validate the data.
	- Activate AREA_TITLE variable
	- Make filter case insensitive
	- FILTER: after filtering, show results below the filter button.
	DONE- IT WAS SOLVED REMPLACING ' ' BY '_' (SEE INDEX LINE 323, BEFORE CALLING block_builder BUG: block size/positioning errors when there are none elements in the block. 
	BUG: values with some characters (like: ":") produce an error in de selector: Uncaught SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document': '#b-Creative commons: BY-SA 3.0' is not a valid selector. 
	
	
CSS / Look
	- Filters tab: fields, button and text field rectangles + paddings
	- Check the css for long lists of fields (specially for the TAB filter)

OTHER
	- Write comments/help in data/config.js.
	- Write comments/help in data/data.js.
	- Save AREA to image with  http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/documentation.html
	
AREA-DATA-EMBEDED	
	- OPTIONAL data-build-in-AREA -> static HTML generated for a given area-config.js with a area-gen.py script.
	-> CHRIS QUESTIONS: Study the option of dividing the data in parameters-object and rest-of-data-object with a call using IDs. Would this method save resources or speed up the process?? Graphically right now, with D3, AREA can represent more squares than before (with DIVs), but the data-in-a-file is now the bottle neck?
