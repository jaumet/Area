The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina initialled at Dayton, Ohio, United States of America, on 21 November 1995 by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (see A/50/790-S/1995/999) provides the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the opportunity to rebuild their lives together in peace and prosperity...

Page 1, 2. 
The Peace Agreement will be signed at the Paris Conference on 14 December 1995. That Conference will mark a further important stage in bringing about recognition between the States in the region and will initiate promotion of good neighbourly relations between them.

Page 1, 3. 
The purpose of the London Peace Implementation Conference is to mobilize the international community behind a new start for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Conference agrees that the peace should result in:...(h) Successful implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium;

Page 2-3, Military implementation 8.
The military mission was described as having the following primary tasks: (a) To ensure continued compliance with the Cessation-of-Hostilities Agreement;

Page 3, Military implementation, 9. 
General Joulwan said that, in addition to these key tasks, IFOR might be asked to undertake the following supporting tasks within the limits of its capabilities: (a) To help create secure conditions for the conduct by others of other tasks associated with the Peace Agreement (though IFOR would not undertake humanitarian tasks itself);

Page 3, Regional stabilization, 12. 
The Conference therefore strongly: (a) Urges the parties to observe the deadlines set out in the Peace Agreement for agreeing on such measures;

Page 4, Civilian implementation, 14. 
Mr. Bildt identified in particular the need for early action in Sarajevo to create confidence between the communities. Bosnia and Herzegovina has requested the cooperation of the High Representative in the project of a unified Sarajevo as the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as called for by the Peace Agreement...

Page 4, High Representative, 18. 
Following consultation with the Government of Bosnia the Conference approved the designation of Mr. Carl Bildt as High Representative and expressed gratitude for his willingness to take on this responsibility. It notes that Mr. Bildt will continue to act as EU Mediator for Former Yugoslavia and in that capacity will work closely with the EU Troika. The Conference invites the United Nations Security Council to agree to Mr. Bildt’s designation as High Representative.

Page 5, Administrative structures for civilian implementation, 20. 
The Conference concludes that, with the signature of the Peace Agreement, important objectives of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia have been met and a new structure is required to manage peace implementation.

Page 6, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 23. 
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has involved great suffering among the civilian population. Over 2.1 million people have been displaced or become refugees. The Conference acknowledges the great contribution made during the conflict by UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, funded in large part by EU, as well as the support given in the countries of asylum. It agrees that an early objective of the Peace Agreement is to create secure conditions for the safe and orderly return of refugees and displaced persons to places of their choice.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 25.
The President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drew attention to the Committee’s tasks in respect of prisoners and missing persons. Fulfilment of the Peace Agreement will require: ...(b) Full cooperation of the parties over the release of prisoners and the provision of information about the fate of persons unaccounted for, as set out in the Peace Agreement.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 27. 
The parties undertake to comply urgently and fully with their obligations in creating the conditions necessary for the early, safe and orderly return of refugees and to cooperate fully with ICRC to ensure the early release of prisoners in accordance with the Peace Agreement.

Page 7, Protection of human rights, 30. 
The Conference takes note of the commitments made by the parties in the Peace Agreement...

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 31. 
The Conference underlines the relationship between the fulfilment by the parties of their commitments in the Peace Agreement, including the observance of the highest standards of human rights and the readiness of the international community to commit financial resources for reconstruction and development.

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 32. 
The Conference decides that, in view of the human rights situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, urgent action is needed in the following areas:...(c) OSCE should appoint an ombudsman, as provided for in the Peace Agreement; (d) The relevant Council of Europe organs should appoint members of the constitutional court for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the human rights chamber, as provided for in the Peace Agreement;

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 33. 
The Conference agrees that the High Representative or his representative will chair a human rights task force in Sarajevo, bringing together the organizations and agencies involved in the implementation of the Peace Agreement.

Page 8, Elections, 34. 
The Conference notes that, between six and nine months after signature of the Peace Agreement, elections supervised by a provisional election commission established by OSCE will be held in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These elections are of paramount importance in bringing about a democratic and stable country.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 46. 
An informal meeting involving a number of delegations closely concerned was held in the margins of the Conference to discuss the implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 47. 
There was recognition of the crucial importance of successful implementation of this Agreement. The international community will play its part. The United Nations Secretary-General will issue a report by 14 December. The United States of America declared its readiness to nominate a candidate to head the Transitional Administration, which will govern the region during the transitional period for which the Basic Agreement provides. It was agreed that no effort should be spared to find and deploy quickly adequate international forces required for the transitional period.

In connection with the renewal of the conflicts between the two armies (the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council) in central Bosnia and some other parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have caused many casualties and serious violations of international humanitarian law, thus posing the threat of far-reaching political consequences, the signatories of this Joint Statement hereby order all military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to immediately cease fire and all hostilities in all areas where such military units are in contact.

Page 1, 3. 
The signatories of this Joint Statement urge all commanders and units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to unconditionally respect all the thus far concluded agreements between the representatives of the Croatian and Muslim peoples in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In particular, they urge military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council to immediately start implementing the Agreement on the legality of both the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the HVO, and on the establishment of a joint command of both forces made up of representatives of both headquarters (enclosure).

The signatories of the Joint Statement reaffirm that the conflicts between units of the HVO and of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are contrary to the policy of the representatives of the two peoples, and that the continuation of such conflicts would seriously jeopardize the achievement of their political goals, i.e. the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of the Vance-Owen plan accepted and signed by the signatories of this Statement, and success in the fight against the aggressor who wants to break the State apart, occupy its territory and annex the occupied territories to ""Greater Serbia"".

In their Joint Communique of 28 February 1996, the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach confirmed that all-party negotiations will be convened on Monday 10 June 1996 following intensive consultations with the relevant political parties and the completion of a broadly acceptable elective process. This paper sets out proposals drawn up by the British and Irish Governments aimed at securing widespread agreement between the two Governments and the relevant political parties on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of all-party negotiations.

Page 1, Agenda, 4. 
Both Governments, as signatories of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, reaffirm that they would be prepared to consider a new and more broadly based agreement, if that can be achieved through direct discussion and negotiation between all the parties concerned...

Page 2, Participation, 6. 
Negotiations will involve the participation, in the appropriate strands, of representatives of both Governments and all those political parties operating in Northern Ireland (hereafter referred to as ""the political parties"") which achieve representation through an elective process and which, as set out in the communique of 28 February 1996, establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process.

Page 2, Participation, 7. 
In the communique of 28 February, both Governments expressed the hope that all parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations. However, both Governments are also agreed that the resumption of Ministerial dialogue with Sinn Fein, and their participation in negotiations, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.

Page 2-3, Participation, 10. 
In their Communique of 28 February, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister said; ""They recognise that confidence building measures will be necessary. As one such measure, all participants would need to make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the International Body. They would also need to address, at that stage, its proposals on decommissioning. Confidence building would also require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.""",GBR,IRL,200,205,315,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

","Page 1, OUTCOME OF DELIBERATIONS, Developments since the Committee's last meeting, 4: The Committee reviewed developments relating to the Liberian crisis since its last meeting in Yamoussoukro on 16 and 17 September 1991. The Committee noted with appreciation that since that meeting, the Republic of Senegal, in keeping with its promise to contribute troops to ECOMOG, had started deploying its troops to Liberia to join ECOMOG. It also noted with pleasure the fact that the parties, in consonance with the agreement reached in Yamoussoukro during the last meeting of the Committee of Five, had nominated a five-member Elections Commission for the organization and supervision of the elections to be held in Liberia, and a five-member ad hoc Supreme Court to adjudicate disputes that may arise from the electoral process, as provided for by the Liberian Constitution. The Committee urged the parties concerned to take all necessary action to ensure that the Interim Elections Commission begins its work without any further delay.

Page 2, OUTCOME OF DELIBERATIONS, Timetable for encampment and disarmament, 6: Recalling the earlier Yamoussoukro Accord of the parties to implement, under ECOMOG supervision, the encampment of their troops in designated locations and their disarmament, and the mandate given to ECOMOG, in liaison with the parties concerned, to work out the practical modalities for the implementation of that Accord, the Meeting considered and agreed a programme of implementation of these important elements of the cease-fire, which is annexed hereto (see enclosure below). This programme envisages the implementation within 60 days of all the modalities for the establishment of the necessary conditions of peace and security on the ground in order to reinforce the confidence of the parties as well as create a proper atmosphere conducive to the holding of free, fair and democratic elections in Liberia not later than six months from the date of this Meeting. The Committee therefore renewed its mandate to ECOMOG to ensure that the programme is smoothly and speedily implemented, in order to make it possible for democratic elections to be held in Liberia within the stipulated period. To this end, it appealed to all the parties concerned to continue to repose trust and confidence in ECOMOG and to cooperate fully with ECOMOG, the Interim Elections Commission, the INN and all other international observers who may wish to observe and monitor the electoral process.

Page 4, Enclosure, Programme of implementation, Tasks: It is clear that trust and confidence from all the parties to the conflict underpin the operations of ECOMOG which, in the light of the Yamoussoukro meetings, should now take us into the next phase. It is therefore recommended that this next phase commence on 15 November 1991, which shall be known as ""D"" Day.",LBR,,450,,341,1062,,860,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

","Page 3, Endorsement of ECOWAS peace plan, 6: The Authority endorsed the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia as embodied in the Banjul communiqué and decisions of the Standing Mediation Committee adopted on 7 August 1990

Page 3, Endorsement of ECOWAS peace plan, 7: The Authority noted with satisfaction that the ECOWAS peace plan had received the widest acceptance and support from Liberians and the international community.

Page 3, Signing of the cease-fire agreement, 8: In giving practical effect to this ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia, the Authority stressed the urgent need for a comprehensive cease-fire to be observed by all the warring parties as a necessary condition for the return of peace and normalcy throughout the territory of Liberia. The Authority therefore warmly commended the two warring parties - the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL) - who had agreed to observe a cease-fire and had signed a cease-fire agreement at Banjul on 24 October 1990,

Page 3, Signing of the cease-fire agreement, 9: At the Extraordinary Session of the Authority at Bamako, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPLF) - the third party to the conflict in Liberia - expressed its readiness to join in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict. The Authority noted with pleasure the acceptance by the NPLF and the other warring parties not only of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia as embodied in the communique and decisions of 7 August 1990 of the Community Standing Mediation Committee, but also their declaration of a cease-fire, which shall come into effect immediately. The Authority urged that the details for the implementation of the cease-fire should be worked out as soon as possible. It expressed the sincere hope that this declaration of cease-fire would mark the complete cessation of all hostilities as the necessary foundation for the return of lasting peace, stability and political accommodation and reconciliation of Liberia.

Page 4, Collective responsibility for ECOMOG, 11: The Authority also considered the necessity for an agreement to be concluded between ECOWAS and the Interim Government of Liberia with respect to the status and operations of the Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia. To this end, the Authority mandated the Executive Secretary to sign an agreement with the Interim Government of Liberia after approval by the Chairman of the Authority.

Page 4, Agreement on interim governance of Liberia, 12: The Authority urgently invited the parties to the conflict in Liberia to enter into dialogue with a view to reaching a political accommodation for the governance of Liberia within the framework of the ECOWAS peace plan. The Authority requested the Standing Mediation Committee to continue its efforts in encouraging such an accommodation between the Liberian groups.

Page 4, Reaffirmation of the Protocol on Non-Aggression, 14. Recalling that it had itself fully recognized the necessity for maintaining the peace and security of the subregion early in the life of the Community through the Protocol on Non-Aggression adopted on 22 April 1978, and believing that the Liberian crisis has given that Protocol a fresh validity, the Authority decided to reaffirm the provisions of the Protocol on Non-Aggression and to urge all member States to adhere fully to their obligations under it. In particular, the Authority recalled the commitment by all member States to refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against any other member State. It further called on all member States to refrain from any action that might prejudice or undermine the smooth and speedy implementation of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia.",LBR,,450,,341,,,860,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

P. Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, with regard to the peace process in Nepal and the request for United Nations assistance in that process (see annexes I-III).
I am pleased to report that peace talks between the Seven Party Alliance forming the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) led to the successful conclusion of an important agreement on 8 November 2006, which has now been  consolidated  by  a  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement,  signed  on 21 November 2006. Earlier this year, following receipt of the identical letters of 9 August 2006 from the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), I appointed Ian Martin as my Personal Representative to undertake consultations with all concerned parties in order to build on the common understanding that had emerged. The agreement of 8 November 2006 represents an important milestone outlining the next steps in the political process leading to free and fair elections for a Constituent Assembly in 2007. In that agreement, the parties have agreed on the basic arrangements for the cantonment of the combatants of the Maoist People’s Liberation Army and the storage of the arms and munitions of both sides. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement declares the commitment of the parties to transform the existing ceasefire into permanent peace.

In this context, I am happy to inform you that the United Nations team, which left Kathmandu a week ago, held extensive yet fruitful consultations with all concerned stakeholders of the peace process here in Nepal. The United Nations team, as I understand, is to submit its report to you on Nepal.
In the meantime, I wish to inform you that further to the Eight-Point Understanding between the Seven Party Alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) of 16 June 2006 and the commitment expressed by the Government of Nepal to the Agreement, the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) hereby request the United Nations to provide its assistance as follows with a view to creating a free and fair atmosphere for the election of a Constituent Assembly and the entire peace process:

...The meeting comes against a backdrop of non-implementation of key provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), more especially the conduct of free and fair general elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan to either confirm unity of Sudan or opt for separation and holding of Abyei referendum on whether Abyei retains its special administrative status in the North or be part of Bahr el Ghazal. The meeting also comes as the simmering crisis in Darfur is intensifying. This underscores the need for extensive dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party with a view to addressing the national crisis Sudan currently faces.

Page 3, PREAMBLE 
...The aim is to ensure full implementation of all peace agreements and all constitutional arrangements prescribed in the Interim National Constitution (INC), 2005; including respect for human rights and the rule of law, political empowerment of women, conduct of free and fair elections, holding of referendum for the people of Southern Sudan and popular consultation for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States. The commitment to resolve the conflict in Darfur is duly emphasized.

Page 3, PREAMBLE 
...The Leadership Council met on September 26 to adopt the APPC’s agenda and to draw up a set of rules to govern proceedings. The general assembly met on September 27 and listened to keynote speech by the Chairman of SPLM and opening remarks by leaders of 28 political parties and 5 civil society organizations, in addition to an address by a delegation from the Peoples’ Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) of Eritrea. On September 28, the APPC set up 5 working committees to discuss key national issues, namely implementation of all peace agreements, democratic transformation, national reconciliation and healing, economic and social situation in addition to foreign policy.

Page 4, 1. DIALOGUE AND NATIONAL CONSENSUS 
1.1. The APPC maintains that the process of forging national consensus requires open dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party. The APPC in Juba is the first such process since the signing of all peace agreements, particularly the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). There is need to continue this free democratic dialogue among all national forces, civil society and women organizations.

Page 4, 2. NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
2.3. The APPC maintains that achieving the objective referred to in Paragraph 2.2 above demand full implementation of outstanding key provisions of the CPA, more especially the provisions related to democratic transformation.

Page 5, 3. PEACE AGREEMENTS
3.1. Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) 
3.1.1. Reaffirms commitment to full implementation of CPA which is essential to sustainable peace and confidence building between the North and South Sudan. In this regard, the APPC resolves the following: 
3.1.1.1. Holding of referendum on self-determination within the period stipulated in the CPA and Interim National Constitution (INC), 2005; 
3.1.1.2. Enactment of Referendum Bill during the prorogation of the current National Assembly, with simple majority vote (50%+1) being threshold for either confirming unity of Sudan or opting for secession and providing for all Southern Sudanese to take part in this process; and 
3.1.1.3. Demarcation of North-South borders prior to the holding of general elections. 
3.1.2. Emphasizes the importance of bringing all laws in consonance with the INC, 2005 
3.1.5. Adhering to the CPA provisions on making unity attractive, the APPC decides to set up a working group focused on developing political, economic and cultural programs to promote unity during the remainder of the Interim Period while at the same time guaranteeing respect for separation in the event the people of Southern Sudan opt for it.

Page 6, 3.2 DARFUR CONFLICT 
3.2.1. Urges the full implementation of Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), particularly the powersharing, wealth-sharing and security provisions. 
3.2.9. Calls for the holding of the Darfur-Darfur dialogue conference with the participation of all stakeholders with the view to sorting out Darfuri internal relations and repairing the social fabric destroyed by the civil war. The conference shall be guided by agreed Declaration of Principles (DOP), resulting in comprehensive agreement that shall be acceptable to all Darfurians and endorsed nationally by an all-party conference.

Page 7, 3. PEACE AGREEMENTS, 3.3. Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA) 
3.3.1. The APPC reaffirms its commitment to full implementation of ESPA and to the lifting of state of emergency. 
3.3.2. The APPC further reiterates its commitment to address the shortcomings of ESPA through the undertaking of complementary political, developmental and remedial measures to resolve the underlying grievances of the people of Eastern Sudan.

Page 7, 3. PEACE AGREEMENTS, 3.4. Cairo Peace Agreement 
3.4.1. The APPC resolves to expedite the implementation of all provisions of Cairo Peace Agreement, particularly those related to democratic transformation, economic reforms and redress for dismissed employees on political grounds as well as to combating corruption.

Page 7, DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION,
4.4. Maintains that the results of the 5th Population Census are contested and that pending agreement on the same, CPA power-sharing ratios shall stand. 

Page 9, 6. FOREIGN POLICY 
6.1. The APPC reaffirms adherence to foreign policy directives, as called for in the CPA and INC, and to the pursuit of foreign policy initiatives predicated on mutual interests and good neighborliness to further Sudan national interests, including, inter alia: 
6.1.1. Ensuring respect for international conventions; 

Page 9, 7. THE WAY FORWARD 
7.4. The APPC maintains that Juba Declaration shall be subject to periodic review, particularly in relation to democratic transformation, elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan, implementation of Abyei Protocol and holding of popular consultation for the people of Blue Nile and South Kordofan States, in addition to finding a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Darfur.
