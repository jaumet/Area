They cover Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia and CIS and the Americas. In some cities we organise team meetings but our communication and coordination is predominantly online.

The community ranges from professional ocean engineers to hobbyists, software developers to students. It's a welcoming community and everyone's feedback and input is valued.\r\nThe idea to build OpenROV was pioneered by Eric Stackpole, a NASA spacecraft engineer at the time and David Lang, a self-taught sailor from Minnesota, who heard about Stackpole building a small, cheap, and robust submarine in his garage. The project started in a garage in Cupertino, with a few guys who wanted to explore an underwater cave, after finding a global community of co-developers on Kickstarter, has evolved into a network of connected devices, exploring the oceans and lakes of the world. After having Matteo Borri design and build the electronics, software and motor system for the first working prototype and subsequently presenting it at the New York Maker's Faire, Lang and Stackpole co-founded OpenROV as an open-source hardware, a startup, and a DIY community.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Contact_page": "NaN", "Type of common resource resulting": "Design", "Phone": "NaN", "Social_networks_accounts": "NaN", "Name": "OpenROV", "Legal_entity": "for profit organization", "The_most_important_type_of_collaboration": "Other", "Physical_address": "NaN", "Type_of_activity": "FLOSS communities, Open hardware, Open design, Gaming communities", "Software_platform_license": "Other licenses", "Year_of_foundation": "2012", "Infrastructure_provider": "NaN", "Languages_of_the _latform": "English", "Keywords": "NaN"},

This operating system that we have created is called Debian.\r\n\r\nAn operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.\r\n\r\nDebian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and other software.\r\n\r\nHowever, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.\r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nOf course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 37500 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) \u2014 all of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer.

To this effect, we aim to increase the ability and skills of SBTF volunteers through a continuous dialogue and coordination with other tech and crisis mapping volunteer efforts. This will enable SBTF to provide a sustainable and predictable service to first responders. We are also directly engaging colleagues from the traditional humanitarian community in order to develop the SBTF structure and protocols with full understanding of principles of effective and ethical humanitarian response.  Some members of the SBTF are professionals working in the fields of ICT and humanitarian response; many others come from diverse backgrounds and have been trained by the SBTF in the necessary skills to contribute.
