Search within an entire database of speeches, for example a whole trial, or everything said by an elected assembly – better than opening hundreds of PDFs and searching manually.
Search within one person’s speeches, even if they only speak occasionally; and each speech is linked to a person, making it easy to see everything someone has said.
Easily share links to a single session (for example at a trial), or even a single speech within a session.

It is a stakeholder trust model of management for large-scale commons that distributes revenues from a shared asset (such as oil on Alaskan land) to every household in the state (roughly $1,000 to $2,000 each year). 
The fund was established in Alaska in 1976, after oil from Alaska began flowing to market through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, to invest at least 25% of the oil money into a dedicated fund for current and future generations of Alaskans. The Fund grew from an initial investment of $734,000 in 1977 to approximately $42.1 billion as of August 31, 2012.","http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/home/index.cfm","","","","Social Enterprise Charity Or Foundation","","for profit organization","1976-01-01 00:00:00","English","","","Others","Other","Resource, Others","Other","Other licenses","","","",""

We also have stopped calling  as a  ""social network"", as it is conceptually quite different from those things. It's more like a collection of channels and web spaces that can all interact.

"Asylos","Asylos was launched as an international network of researchers who act on request from our partner lawyers in Europe to substantiate asylum claims. The research is run exclusively by volunteers from around the globe. The founding principle of Asylos is a simple one: everyone with computer access and two hours per week can help make the legal system in Europe live up to its own standards. Our reports are tailor-made for individual cases. The researchers offer a variety of expertise, a combination of more than thirty languages and a fresh perspective to investigate missing information. They vary in age, profession and experience but they have a common goal: to make a real, measurable difference.

Asylos combines a commitment to donate time and expertise with a flexible work organization:  our researchers can choose when and where to spend time on Asylos. They work within teams of regional specialists supervised by a coordinator.  Currently, the coordinators are predominantly based in Paris, London and Brussels. They cover Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia and CIS and the Americas. In some cities we organise team meetings but our communication and coordination is predominantly online. Asylos currently has 50 volunteers working with lawyers in France and Belgium. We hope to start working with lawyers in the UK and other European countries shortly.","http://www.asylos.eu","http://www.twitter.com/asylos_research","","","Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network","","not for profit organization","2011-01-01 00:00:00","English, French, Russian","","","Collaborative research","Physical resource","Resource","No license","No license","","","",""

"OpenROV","OpenROV is a open-source underwater robot. Its operating system is based on Linux. It includes arduino code and node.js code running on the BeagleBone.
OpenROV is also a DIY community centered around underwater robots for exploration & adventure, formed by a group of amateur and professional ROV builders and operators from over 50 countries who have a passion for exploring the deep and are working together to create more accessible, affordable, and awesome tools for underwater exploration.
The backbone of the project is the global community of DIY ocean explorers who are working, tinkering and improving the OpenROV design. The community ranges from professional ocean engineers to hobbyists, software developers to students. It's a welcoming community and everyone's feedback and input is valued.
The idea to build OpenROV was pioneered by Eric Stackpole, a NASA spacecraft engineer at the time and David Lang, a self-taught sailor from Minnesota, who heard about Stackpole building a small, cheap, and robust submarine in his garage. The project started in a garage in Cupertino, with a few guys who wanted to explore an underwater cave, after finding a global community of co-developers on Kickstarter, has evolved into a network of connected devices, exploring the oceans and lakes of the world. After having Matteo Borri design and build the electronics, software and motor system for the first working prototype and subsequently presenting it at the New York Maker's Faire, Lang and Stackpole co-founded OpenROV as an open-source hardware, a startup, and a DIY community.

"DiyDrones","Community for amateur Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This community created the Arduino-based ArduPilot, the world's first universal autopilot (planes, multicopters of all sorts and ground rovers). The Pixhawk and APM 2.6 autopilots run a variety of powerful free and open UAV software systems, including: ArduCopter, a fully-autonomous multicopter and heli UAV system; ArduPlane, a pro-level UAV system for planes of all types; ArduRover, a fully-autonomous ground-based vehicle system.
ArduCopter is an open source multicopter aerial vehicle platform created by the DIY Drones community based on the Arduino platform and sold by 3D Robotics.
The free software approach from ArduCopter is similar to that of the Paparazzi Project and PX4 autopilot where low cost and availability enables its hobbyist use in small remotely piloted aircraft such as micro air vehicles and miniature UAVs.
The full-featured multicopter UAV controller won the Sparkfun 2013 Autonomous Vehicle Competition. A team of developers from around the globe are constantly improving and refining the performance and capabilities.
Programming and mission operations are done through an elegant and well-developed software interface. The entire package is designed to be easily approachable for the novice, while remaining open-ended for custom applications, education, and research use.

"Freicoin","Although mining is necessary for security, it consumes real world resources and it is not necessary to issue 100% of the total initial monetary base through mining in order to secure the network. The Freicoin Foundation will issue 80% of the initial monetary base to prevent this wasteful issuance (that maximizes the costs of production to minimize seigniorage) and to experiment with new issuance mechanisms.

The goal is to distribute the 80 million FRC before 2016. After this 3 year period the monetary base will remain stable at 100 million FRC and the 5% demurrage will be distributed p2p. This 3 year timeframe is a compromise between the foundation as a tool to bootstrap the currency and the need of an eventual removal of the issuance role of the foundation in order for the currency to become purely p2p. That means the annual 5% will go in full to miners if no alternative has been found.

The challenge is to design schemes in which the foundation doesn't have much control over the final issuance decisions while at the same time it can ensure transparency and that funds aren't issued against the foundation's principles.

If a fully p2p issuance mechanism alternative to mining is found, a mechanism (for example, proof-of-stake voting) could be established to determine how much goes to security (miners) and how much to the alternative.","http://freico.in/","http://twitter.com/freicoin, http://identi.ca/freicoin, http://www.facebook.com/pages/Freicoin/227107500747148","","http://freicoin.freeforums.org/","Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network","","other","2014-01-01 00:00:00","English","","cryptocurrency money bitcoin","P2P currency","Exchange","Resource, Others","Creative Commons: Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)","MIT License","Contributors ","Daemon ","",""

"Debian","The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is called Debian.

An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.

Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and other software.

However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.

A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.

Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 37500 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) — all of it free.

It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.

"The Standby task force","The Standby Task Force (SBTF) organizes digital volunteers into a flexible, trained and prepared network ready to deploy in crises.  The concept for the Task Force was launched at the 2010 International Conference on Crisis Mapping (ICCM 2010) to streamline online volunteer support for crisis mapping following lessons learned in Haiti, Chile and Pakistan, and to provide a dedicated interface for the humanitarian community. Our main objective is to effectively assist crisis affected communities through co-operation with local and international responders. To this effect, we aim to increase the ability and skills of SBTF volunteers through a continuous dialogue and coordination with other tech and crisis mapping volunteer efforts. This will enable SBTF to provide a sustainable and predictable service to first responders. We are also directly engaging colleagues from the traditional humanitarian community in order to develop the SBTF structure and protocols with full understanding of principles of effective and ethical humanitarian response.  Some members of the SBTF are professionals working in the fields of ICT and humanitarian response; many others come from diverse backgrounds and have been trained by the SBTF in the necessary skills to contribute. The SBTF is a volunteer organization; it is a platform, a shared space for those who have skills to offer (or are willing to learn skills) to assist crisis affected communities through the use of technology.","http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/","https://www.facebook.com/StandbyTaskForce, https://twitter.com/SBTaskForce, https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.standbytaskforce.com%2Fcontact%2F, http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/contact/?share=linkedin&nb=1","coreteam@standbytaskforce.com ","","Social Enterprise Charity Or Foundation","United States","not for profit organization","2010-01-01 00:00:00","English","","humanitarian help, Disaster Response","Community networks","Building collective process","Service","Copyright","No license","Sahana, Humanitarian Open Street Map, Crisis Common, Crisis mappers, ","Wordpress","",""

"R "," R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.
