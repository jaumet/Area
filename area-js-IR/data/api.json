You'll control the look and feel, plug in third-party services you love, and manage your backers\u2014all without writing a line of code.\r\n\r\nUnlike most third-party platforms, there are no arbitrary guidelines here. CrowdtiltOpen can be used for collecting pre-orders, raising funds for charity, a group experience, or anything else you can imagine.\r\n\r\nYou can launch a campaign on your own domain (say, campaign.soylent.me), run multiple campaigns at once, and change your page whenever you want. And with first-ever features like recurring-billing based rewards and Bitcoin integration, your imagination's the only limit.

"nid":"396","name":"Friendica ","description":"Friendica is an open source, free social web server running on the popular LAMP stack. Think WordPress or Drupal, but for social. It is a mature platform with over two years of development behind it, and provides a wide range of connectors to both legacy and indie social networks. Your \"friends\" can be from Facebook, Diaspora, Twitter, StatusNet, pump.io, weblogs and RSS feeds - and even email. No other project has ever brought together the social universe into a single federated stream to this degree. We have pioneered ground-breaking technology such as decentralised photo albums with working privacy controls and cross-site wall-to-wall posting via hidden single sign-on. Not even Facebook will protect your private photos from \"fuskers\" (look it up, but be warned - it's real creepy).  If you make a Friendica photo private, it's private.\r\nWe also have stopped calling  as a  \"social network\", as it is conceptually quite different from those things. It's more like a collection of channels and web spaces that can all interact.  Sure, you can use it as a \"social network\" and many people will. But that's like saying you can use a mobile phone to make phone calls.  Most mobile phones can do a lot more.","homepage":{"value":"http://friendica.com/","title":"NaN","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://friendica.com/","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},"social_networks_accounts":[{"value":"https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki","title":"Github","attributes":"NaN","path":"https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},{"value":"https://twitter.com/FriendicaNews","title":"Twitter","attributes":"NaN","path":"https://twitter.com/FriendicaNews","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}}],"email":"NaN","contact_page":{"value":"http://dir.friendica.com/directory/forum","title":"NaN","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://dir.friendica.com/directory/forum","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},"organisation_type":"Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network","physical_address":"NaN","legal_entity":"not for profit organization","year_of_foundation":"2012-01-01 00:00:00","languages":["English"],"phone":"NaN","keywords":["Social Networks","transmedia  service"],"type_of_activity":["FLOSS communities","Free software social networks and platforms"],"most_important_type_of_collaboration":"Collage","type_of_common_resource_resulting":["Service"],"user_generated_content_license":"Other","software_platform_license":"AGPL license","owner":"Friendica community ","infrastructure_provider":"Friendica volunters ","other_information":"NaN","Scope":"NaN"},{

Our reports are tailor-made for individual cases. The researchers offer a variety of expertise, a combination of more than thirty languages and a fresh perspective to investigate missing information. They vary in age, profession and experience but they have a common goal: to make a real, measurable difference.\r\n\r\nAsylos combines a commitment to donate time and expertise with a flexible work organization:  our researchers can choose when and where to spend time on Asylos. They work within teams of regional specialists supervised by a coordinator.  Currently, the coordinators are predominantly based in Paris, London and Brussels. They cover Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia and CIS and the Americas. In some cities we organise team meetings but our communication and coordination is predominantly online. Asylos currently has 50 volunteers working with lawyers in France and Belgium.

The community ranges from professional ocean engineers to hobbyists, software developers to students. It's a welcoming community and everyone's feedback and input is valued.\r\nThe idea to build OpenROV was pioneered by Eric Stackpole, a NASA spacecraft engineer at the time and David Lang, a self-taught sailor from Minnesota, who heard about Stackpole building a small, cheap, and robust submarine in his garage. The project started in a garage in Cupertino, with a few guys who wanted to explore an underwater cave, after finding a global community of co-developers on Kickstarter, has evolved into a network of connected devices, exploring the oceans and lakes of the world. After having Matteo Borri design and build the electronics, software and motor system for the first working prototype and subsequently presenting it at the New York Maker's Faire, Lang and Stackpole co-founded OpenROV as an open-source hardware, a startup, and a DIY community.\r\n\r\n\r\n","homepage":{"value":"http://openrov.com/","title":"NaN","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://openrov.com/","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},"social_networks_accounts":"NaN","email":"NaN","contact_page":"NaN","organisation_type":"Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network","physical_address":"NaN","legal_entity":"for profit organization","year_of_foundation":"2012-01-01 00:00:00","languages":["English"],"phone":"NaN","keywords":"NaN","type_of_activity":["FLOSS communities","Open hardware","Open design","Gaming communities"],"most_important_type_of_collaboration":"Other","type_of_common_resource_resulting":["Design"],"user_generated_content_license":"Other","software_platform_license":"Other licenses","owner":"NaN","infrastructure_provider":"NaN","other_information":"NaN","Scope":"NaN"},{

"nid":"350","name":"Freicoin","description":"Although mining is necessary for security, it consumes real world resources and it is not necessary to issue 100% of the total initial monetary base through mining in order to secure the network.

After this 3 year period the monetary base will remain stable at 100 million FRC and the 5% demurrage will be distributed p2p. This 3 year timeframe is a compromise between the foundation as a tool to bootstrap the currency and the need of an eventual removal of the issuance role of the foundation in order for the currency to become purely p2p. That means the annual 5% will go in full to miners if no alternative has been found.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is to design schemes in which the foundation doesn't have much control over the final issuance decisions while at the same time it can ensure transparency and that funds aren't issued against the foundation's principles.\r\n\r\nIf a fully p2p issuance mechanism alternative to mining is found, a mechanism (for example, proof-of-stake voting) could be established to determine how much goes to security (miners) and how much to the alternative.","homepage":{"value":"http://freico.in/","title":"NaN","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://freico.in/","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},"social_networks_accounts":[{"value":"http://twitter.com/freicoin","title":"Twitter","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://twitter.com/freicoin","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},{"value":"http://identi.ca/freicoin","title":"indeti.ca","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://identi.ca/freicoin","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},{"value":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Freicoin/227107500747148","title":"Facebook","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Freicoin/227107500747148","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}}],"email":"NaN","contact_page":{"value":"http://freicoin.freeforums.org/","title":"NaN","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://freicoin.freeforums.org/","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},"organisation_type":"Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network","physical_address":"NaN","legal_entity":"other","year_of_foundation":"2014-01-01 00:00:00","languages":["English"],"phone":"NaN","keywords":["cryptocurrency money bitcoin"],"type_of_activity":["P2P currency"],"most_important_type_of_collaboration":"Exchange","type_of_common_resource_resulting":["Resource","Others"],"user_generated_content_license":"Creative Commons: Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)","software_platform_license":"MIT License","owner":"Contributors ","infrastructure_provider":"Daemon ","other_information":"NaN","Scope":"NaN"},{

This operating system that we have created is called Debian.\r\n\r\nAn operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.\r\n\r\nDebian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and other software.\r\n\r\nHowever, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.\r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nOf course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 37500 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) \u2014 all of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian \u2014 carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.

The concept for the Task Force was launched at the 2010 International Conference on Crisis Mapping (ICCM 2010) to streamline online volunteer support for crisis mapping following lessons learned in Haiti, Chile and Pakistan, and to provide a dedicated interface for the humanitarian community. Our main objective is to effectively assist crisis affected communities through co-operation with local and international responders. To this effect, we aim to increase the ability and skills of SBTF volunteers through a continuous dialogue and coordination with other tech and crisis mapping volunteer efforts. This will enable SBTF to provide a sustainable and predictable service to first responders. We are also directly engaging colleagues from the traditional humanitarian community in order to develop the SBTF structure and protocols with full understanding of principles of effective and ethical humanitarian response.  Some members of the SBTF are professionals working in the fields of ICT and humanitarian response; many others come from diverse backgrounds and have been trained by the SBTF in the necessary skills to contribute. The SBTF is a volunteer organization; it is a platform, a shared space for those who have skills to offer (or are willing to learn skills) to assist crisis affected communities through the use of technology.","homepage":{"value":"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/","title":"NaN","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},"social_networks_accounts":[{"value":"https://www.facebook.com/StandbyTaskForce","title":"Facebook","attributes":"NaN","path":"https://www.facebook.com/StandbyTaskForce","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},{"value":"https://twitter.com/SBTaskForce","title":"Twitter","attributes":"NaN","path":"https://twitter.com/SBTaskForce","options":{"query":"NaN","fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},{"value":"https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.standbytaskforce.com%2Fcontact%2F","title":"Google+","attributes":"NaN","path":"https://plus.google.com/share","options":{"query":{"url":"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/contact/"},"fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}},{"value":"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/contact/?share=linkedin&nb=1","title":"Linkedin","attributes":"NaN","path":"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/contact/","options":{"query":{"share":"linkedin","nb":"1"},"fragment":"NaN","attributes":"NaN"}}],"email":"coreteam@standbytaskforce.com ","contact_page":"NaN","organisation_type":"Social Enterprise Charity Or Foundation","physical_address":{"country":"US","administrative_area":"NaN","sub_administrative_area":null,"locality":"NaN","dependent_locality":null,"postal_code":"NaN","thoroughfare":"NaN","premise":"NaN","sub_premise":null,"organisation_name":null,"name_line":null,"first_name":null,"last_name":null,"data":null},"legal_entity":"not for profit organization","year_of_foundation":"2010-01-01 00:00:00","languages":["English"],"phone":"NaN","keywords":["humanitarian help","Disaster Response"],"type_of_activity":["Community networks"],"most_important_type_of_collaboration":"Building collective process","type_of_common_resource_resulting":["Service"],"user_generated_content_license":"Copyright","software_platform_license":"No license","owner":"Sahana, Humanitarian Open Street Map, Crisis Common, Crisis mappers, ","infrastructure_provider":"Wordpress","other_information":"NaN","Scope":"NaN"},{

The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.\r\n\r\nOne of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.

Moxley, a professor of English and the director of the first-year writing program at the University of South Florida, Writing Commons was developed from a highly regarded text into one of the most heavily used open textbooks on the web. Following a crowd-sourcing process, Writing Commons now offers an interactive and comprehensive introduction to college-level writing. In 2012, Writing Commons was viewed by over 145,000 unique users for a total of 167,000 users. Writing Commons was developed from College Writing Online (Longman/Pearson, 2003)[3] a first-year composition textbook written by Joseph Moxley. Awarded the Distinguished Book Award by Computers and Composition: an International Journal in 2004,[4] College Writing Online has since been republished as Writing Commons in an open textbook format.
