OVERVIEW:

We are database hunters!

We are for the public data and we encourage you to add some data to AREA.

    * Data from social moviments
        * Data from university studies
	    * Data from statistics
	        * ...

		Conditions and format to include a database in AREA:
		1) Format of the data
		Currently, AREA represents Mysql databases

		2) AREA represents fields of the database table that have a number DISTINCT values between 2 and 50. We recommended less than 20 values.

		DISTINCT is a command used in Mysql databases. An example: supose we have a table with a list of people. If we have a field in a table of a database call gender.
		We can have 3 options to choose for each entry in the table. That's:
		    - female
		        - male
			    - other

			    Every entry on the table will have to take one of this values. In this case there are 3 distinct values for the gender field of the table.
			    This field is representable with AREA.
			    The more representable fields in a table, the more number of AREA representations for this table.

			    If the data has more than one table, we can configure the relations between tables in the data configuration and labels for each field name.

			    3) Number of entries: currently AREA can represent 10.000 maximum, but this depends on the resources of the computer you are using.

			    If you have any doubt about this process and you have a data that could be interesting to represent with AREA, please contact us (http://nualart.com/area/d/?q=node/2)

Area technically:

AREA is a treemap multi generator, that meants AREA gives you several ways to display lots of data entities.
Most of treemaps represent the entities in a non fix size. The traditional treemap applications are applied to represent a directory tree of an operating system. The size of the entities is relative to the size of the files and directories, so it makes really intuitive to detect the big ones. Colors are used to represent the kind of file.
