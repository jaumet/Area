INSTALL

AREA is a cgi perl script. It has been used under Linux, Apache with perl.

0) Get the code using SUBVERSION: svn checkout  http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/area
   (about SUBVERSION: http://svn-book.red-bean.com/)

1) Set permissions to execute .cgi and .pl files for the directory where Area is placed in your Apache configuration,
   and restart Apache.

2) You require some CPAN perl modules (http://search.cpan.org)

   [name_of_Module]:

	CGI::FormBuilder
	CGI::Session
	DBI;
	Data::Dumper
	POSIX
	HTML::Entities
	XML::Simple

   - You can install it with: 
   
   		perl -MCPAN -e 'install [Name_of_Module]'

3) You need a Database installed and access to read the Database. I recommend to star with only one table.
Then you need to edit the configuration file Area/Datasources.pm. The one that comes with this Area distro is just a sample

4) Go to http://yourdomain/path_to_area/areac1.cgi?datasrcname=[NAME of your data]

* [NAME of your data] is setup in the config file Area/Datasources.pm
